    Kheema is a Hindi word which means to mince. kheema is one dish I have grown up seeing made at home and it was not veg kheema :-(. Even in the parsi restaurants in Mumbai, my folks would like the kheema based dishes, especially kheema pav â€“ spiced minced meat and peas served with Indian buns/pav. My mom makes a fab kheema pav, but this recipe is not a vegetarian adaption of her recipe.

    This is my own version of making veg kheema. Its nice & delicious way to include vegetables in your diet. Since the vegetables are minced or grated, the cooking time is also less. But the preparation time is a bit more as if you hand grate the vegetables, it does take time. If you have a food processor then using it will surely reduce time taken to grate or finely chop the veggies.

    The kheema can be served with rotis, naan or even plain bread or Indian pav-buns. This can also be a side dish accompanied with dal-rice combo. This recipe is a good breakfast, brunch or tiffin option.

    Here I have used cauliflower, carrots, french beans, green peas and button mushrooms to make the kheema. I am sure that even with other veggies, the kheema would taste great.

    You can even add your choice of veggies while making the kheema. the dish is semi dry and goes well with chapatis, rotis and even breads or buns accompanied with a vegetable salad or vegetable raita.
